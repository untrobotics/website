                  <h1>What We Do</h1>
		  <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>UNT Robotics is a broad engineering student organisation at the <a href="https://www.unt.edu/">University of North Texas</a>.</p>
				  <p>We focus on developing student's skills in engineering &amp; robotics, which involves a range of beginner workshops, industry talks, robotics-based hackathons, recreational projects and competitions.</p>
                  <div class="well-custom">
                    <h5><strong>X</strong> members from <strong>Y</strong> majors.</h5>
                  </div>
                  <p>We've grown a lot since our conception in late 2018. UNT's Engineering program teaches students much of the theory of needed to flourish, however there was a gap for the invaluable hands on experience that we give our members. As a result, we've become a part of the growth and development of students here at UNT.</p>
                  <p>As a student organisation, we also develop the social skills of students. We host social and team building events and extensively network with industry partners who value the skills that we have given their recruits.</p>
					<h3>Workshops</h3>
				  <p>We host bi-weekly workshops on topics from electrical circuits and programming microcontrollers to computer-aided design (CAD) and image processing. These workshops are tailored to teaching new skills to novices, they are perfect for new students to get a head start in their field or for students in other majors to branch our and learn about robotics.</p>
				  <p>The workshops consist of a 1-2 hour course held after our evening meetings where one can turn up with no knowledge of the topic and leave with tangible skills to take home. We provide all of the equipment needed and bring in experts to teach each workshop.</p>
					<h3>Socials</h3>
				  <p>No student organisation is complete without the friends &amp; family that one makes throughout their tenure. We develop our students as people, not just academically. The aspect of building relationships is just as important as any academic teaching because the relationships that students forge when taking part in our social events can improve their academic life by engaging with like-minded and driven individuals.</p>
					<h3>Talks</h3>
				  <p>At UNT Robotics, we invite companies and individuals out to talk about their expertise. We have had a number of esteemed talks by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-evenden/">David Evenden</a> of <a href="https://www.standardusercyber.com/">Standard User Cyber Security</a>, engineers from <a href="https://www.bellflight.com/">Bell Flight</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddenmengwasser/">Madden Mengwasser</a> from <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/"></a> and many more. If you would like to come speak at one of our events, <a href="./contact">contact us!</a></p>
					<h3>Networking</h3>
				  <p>A big part of our development is encouraging &amp; facilitating networking. This is mutually beneficial for the students and companies alike who love to recruit our alumni. We also have working relationships with companies who offer talks, parts and equipment and mentorship every semester.</p>
					<!--<h3>Botathon</h3>
				  <p></p>-->
					<h3>Competitions</h3>
				  <p>UNT Robotics currently competes in <a href="https://www.roboticseducation.org/vex-u/">VexU</a>, a university based robotics competition. In the past, we have competed in IEEE Region 5 competitions. In 2019, we placed third at competition in Louisiana.</p>
					<h3>Recreational Projects</h3>
				  <p>These fun projects are for anyone and everyone that just wants to have fun and work on a project together. These projects tend to be very long-term because we don't require any time commitment, allowing people to come and go as they wish. Anyone can propose a project to work on, and so long as they get a team together we will support them in building it.</p>
					<h3>Equipment Checkout</h3>
				  <p>Equipment checkout is currently paused due to COVID-19. We hope to have a system in place soon. </p>
