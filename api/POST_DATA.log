array (
  'text' => '@potatoes little announcement: for some reason registration hasn\'t come through so we can\'t register for events yet. If this isn\'t solved soon we won\'t be able to reserve a room On campus on time so I have two options

1. I can push meetings one week over (we end up with the same amount of meetings)
2. We start the second week and I can go on monday to all departments to see if I can reserve a room for the first meeting like I did last semester.  

I\'ll make a poll to see what you guys like best. ',
