# UNT Robotics Website

This repository contains the source code to our website & our APIs.

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to inspire and teach people the skills to achieve their goals in robotics. We provide our members with the opportunities to learn, create and grow. Through hands-on workshops, an open workspace and competitions, we aim to give our members the educational and career opportunities outside of what engineering students obtain in the classroom. We welcome people of all skill levels.
