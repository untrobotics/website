                                <p>Alex is a mechanical engineering junior specializing in design and management. As President of the organisation, he oversees its direction and ensures it serves it purpose. He has been competing in robotics competitions ever since middle school and has a plethora of skills to teach to and mentor new roboticists and enthusiasts. These experiences have led to his form belief that projects are the best way for engineers to learn and test their skills, not only in isolation, but in conjunction with other disciplines. With that in mind he hopes to give the students of UNT the opportunity to learn engineering the proper way.</p>

                                <p>Abdus Samee is an ECE graduate whose love for engineering must be seen to be believed. Being a former Toastmaster, he has a flair for speaking which convinces the listener to accept the facts that he puts forward. His never ending hunger for knowledge has enabled him to achieve a lot in a short time. Education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity is what he says. Progress never comes without struggles, but his persistence helped him reach his dream destination. He is also the Vice Chair for UNT IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, and a IEEE Eta Kappa Nu Honor Student. The words of Ford inspired him to keep going. 'When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind and not with it.'</p>
